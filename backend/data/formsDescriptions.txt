What will happen to my Complaint/What happens after I submit the form?

It should be noted that an Adjudication Officer may, at any time, dismiss a complaint if he or she is of
the opinion that it is frivolous or vexatious.
Once the complaint has been registered you will receive a more detailed acknowledgement together
with information on the next steps. Complaint Application and Specific Complaint Reference
Numbers will also be shown on that acknowledgement which should be used in all subsequent
correspondence or communications.
Please note that in all instances where a complaint falls to be considered by a Workplace
Relations Commission Adjudication Officer a copy of this form and all relevant
correspondence will be copied to, and exchanged between, the parties to the complaint.
In certain cases the Workplace Relations Commission may contact the Complainant and the
Respondent with a view to attempting to encourage and facilitate both parties to resolve issues as an
alternative to a formal hearing or an inspection (Mediation Service).
If one or both parties do not wish to engage in mediation or if attempts at mediation are
unsuccessful, the complaint will be referred to an Adjudication Officer.
